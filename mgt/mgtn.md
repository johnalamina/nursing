Some questions which might be asked when seeking to undersand the the management team include
1. is the management team dominated by a single individual?  if so, who is it and what values and beliefs does he/she hold strongly? Strong  managers can be highly successful, but they can be dificult to remove, especially if they combine the roles of chairman and chief executive.
2. Does the organisation have a problem in recuriting and retaining senior staf as might be indicated by rapid management turnover?  This can arise from the problems of working with an autocratic chief executive who refuses to  allow others to develop the company in ways not known the them.
3. Has the top team been ain place too long, run out of ideas and in need of rejuvenation?  Is the chief executive increasingly involved in outside interests, suggesting he or she has less energy to devote to the business.  is there a balance between experience and youth?
4. Are senior staff close to retirement so that there may be a succession  problem.  has the existing chairman or chief executive groomed a successor to enable a smooth changeover at the top?
5. Have there been significant changes to the board of directors, and in particular changes of the chairman or chief executive, perhaps indicating a movement away from previous policies pursued by the company?
6. If there have been resignations from the board, are these  due to retirement, or do they signal disagreements amongst the directors on the direction and running of the company?  The resignation of senior non-executive directors, in particular can be a warning sign that all is not well.
7. What has been the past track record of the management team? Have they  proved that they can manage both in bad times as well as good?

### Taking action to add value

Managers all too often make poor judgements resulting in either value being destroyed or very little net value being created.  To understand why this is the case it is important to focus again on three key components of crafting a successful corporate strategy.
1. Portfolio management
2. corprorate core competence
3. enhanace business unit performance

#### Portfolio managment
Reasons why companies diversify  can be grouped into the following
1. Risk spreading
2. growth
3. synergy
4. financial engineering

#### Summary
1. Identify the current market value of the company
2. To what extend has share price changed over the last year
3. Does the change in share price suggest that existing management is able to create significant value, or does it need a new management team to unlock the value of the business.
4. have directors recently bought or sold shares?
5. Does the company communicate effectively with its shareholders?  have there been any marked changes fo communicating performance recently?
6. What internal improvements have been taken by management, and/or are in th process of being implemented to add value?
7. What external improvements - acquisitions - have been pursued to strengthen competitive advantage and thereby increase long-term value?
8. What external  improvements - acquisitions - have been pursued to strengthen competitive advantage and thereby increase long-term value?
9. What actions, if any, have been taken with respect to financial engineering?  have these assisted value creation?

A company makes a profit when its revenue is in excess of of its expenses. A loss is made when revenue is insufficient to cover the expenses.
