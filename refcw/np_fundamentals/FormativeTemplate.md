Description
On one of my placements in the ward, I cared for IB who was diagnosed of Crohn’s disease, doubly incontinent and bedbound. IB woke up from sleep to realized that she had soiled herself due to incontinence (urine and faeces) and was understandably upset that staff had not awakened her to freshen up. IB requested assistance with personal care, and a Clinical Support Worker (CSW) responded to her call. However, IB declined the CSW's assistance due to perceived rudeness, requesting that another member of staff to assist her with personal care. Upon learning about the situation, I sought permission from my Practice Assessor to offer my assistance to IB which she accepted. I went to IB with all the materials needed to provide personal care and IB shared that she had refused the CSW's care due to perceived rudeness just in case I am not aware. I was aware that the patient had some independence with personal care and would require minimal assistance. I politely and in clear terms asked IB
to guide me on how she would prefer to be assisted with personal care which she explained. I was also checking IB’s understanding from time to time by repeating myself during communication to minimize any mistakes or misunderstanding. Following IB’s instructions thoroughly, I was able to assist IB effectively which ultimately made her happy. This experience underscored the importance of communication, respect and patient-centred
care in nursing .

Person-centred care is a holistic model that takes into account an individual’s desires, values, family situations, social circumstances, and lifestyles. It shifts the focus from viewing the patient as a mere set of symptoms or lost abilities to recognizing them as a unique individual. This approach considers the whole person, acknowledging each individual’s unique qualities, abilities, interests, references, and needs.

Person-centred care was exemplified with IB by respecting her autonomy and dignity. When IB declined the CSW’s assistance due to perceived rudeness, I respected her decision, sought permission, and offered your assistance, which she accepted. This action demonstrates a key aspect of person-centred care: valuing the feelings and preferences of the patient.

Furthermore, you recognized that IB had some independence with personal care and would require minimal assistance. By asking her to guide you on how she would prefer to be assisted with personal care, you empowered her and acknowledged her ability to
make decisions about her own care. This action promotes self-determination and autonomy, which are crucial aspects of person-centred care.

Effective communication is another key element of person-centred care. You demonstrated this by checking IB’s understanding from time to time and repeating yourself during communication to minimize any mistakes or misunderstanding. This ensured that you and IB were on the same page, which is essential for effective care delivery.

Finally, by following IB’s instructions thoroughly, you were able to assist her effectively, which ultimately made her happy. This shows that person-centred care can lead to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes.

In conclusion, your actions in this scenario embody the principles of person-centred care. You respected IB’s autonomy, communicated effectively, and provided care that was tailored to her specific needs and preferences. This not only enhanced the quality of care you provided but also improved IB’s care experience. Therefore, this scenario serves as a compelling example of the
importance of person-centred care in nursing practice.

4. Benefit to Colleagues: By stepping in to assist when IB declined the CSW’s help, you demonstrated a cooperative spirit and a willingness to share your skills for the benefit of your colleagues. Your actions could serve as a learning experience for the CSW and other colleagues, emphasizing the importance of patient preferences and effective communication in providing care.
5. Benefit to Patients: Ultimately, by sharing your skills, knowledge, and experience, you were able to provide high-quality, person-centred care to IB. This not only improved her care experience but also likely contributed to better health outcomes.

In conclusion, sharing your skills, knowledge, and experience is a fundamental aspect of the nurse’s role in   practicing effectively. It facilitates collaboration with colleagues, fosters a cooperative relationship with the patient, and promotes shared decision-making.
Therefore, it is a crucial element in scenarios like the one with IB.

The importance of critical reflection and its role in enhancing the nurse’s knowledge/skill to practice effectively when providing person-centred care (approximately 500 words): What is critical reflection. From your reflection what worked well, what areas do you need to consider in relation to skill/knowledge to enhance your practice as you progress to year 2. How does this 
skill/knowledge enable you to practice effectively when providing person-centred care? Here, you could consider your training (both academic and clinical experience), look at the future nurse standards, look at your ePAD document in relation to the professional values and proficiencies.

Critical reflection is an integral part of nursing practice, playing a pivotal role in enhancing a nurse’s knowledge and skills to practice effectively when providing person-centred care.

At its core, critical reflection involves examining and questioning one’s own thoughts, actions, and experiences in a structured way. It encourages nurses to delve deeper into their experiences, challenging assumptions, recognizing biases, and identifying areas for improvement. This process fosters personal and professional growth, leading to enhanced knowledge and skills.

In the context of person-centred care, critical reflection is particularly important. Person-centred care is about seeing the person as an individual, rather than focusing on their illness or abilities they may have lost. It involves considering people’s desires, values, family situations, social circumstances, and lifestyles. To deliver such care effectively, nurses need to continually reflect on their
practice, ensuring that they are truly meeting the unique needs of each individual.

For instance, in the scenario with IB, your critical reflection on the situation allowed you to recognize and respect IB’s autonomy and dignity. When IB declined the CSW’s assistance due to perceived rudeness, you reflected on her feelings and preferences, which led you to seek permission and offer your assistance. This shows how critical reflection can enhance a nurse’s ability to practice person-centred care effectively.

Moreover, your reflection on IB’s independence with personal care guided your approach to her care. You recognized that she would require minimal assistance, which led you to ask her to guide you on how she would prefer to be assisted. This not only empowered IB but also ensured that the care provided was in line with her preferences.

Furthermore, your reflection on the importance of effective communication led you to check IB’s understanding from time to time and repeat yourself during communication to minimize any mistakes or misunderstanding. This ensured that you and IB were on the same page, which is essential for effective care delivery.

In conclusion, critical reflection is a powerful tool that can enhance a nurse’s knowledge and skills to practice effectively when providing person-centred care. It fosters personal and professional growth, promotes self-awareness, and leads to improved patient
outcomes. Therefore, it is a crucial aspect of nursing practice.
