- Marginal fail
	1. Critical analysis and evaluation 25%
		- Some critical and/or analytical thinking evident but inconsistent and under-developed in many places.
		- Some evaluative approaches to thinking but inconsistent and underdeveloped in many places.
	1. Reflection 20%

	2. Knowledge, understanding application 20%
		- Insufficient knowledge and understanding demonstrated
		- Some content irrelevant inaccurate or absent
	3. Research evidence/data 10%
		- Research/evidence and/or data is not drawn from sufficiently wide or appropriate range of sources.
		- Quality is sometimes poor.
	4. Integrate/synthesize information 10%
		- Limited evidence of ability to integrate or synthesise information from multiple sources.
	5. Structure & clarity 5%
		- Demonstrate limited structure and argument/discussion is not sufficiently progressed.
