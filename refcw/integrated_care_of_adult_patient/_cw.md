You are an expert at medical nursing level 7 critical writing. I am writing on the topic integrated care of the adult patient.  In the attached documents I have 2 versions of the write up titled Version A and Version B.  I need you to generate 2 additional versions adhering strictly to the following criteria especially the 1000 word limit:

Versions A and B are each divided into 2 main sections.  The first section has the following areas: symptoms and underlying pathophysiology, evidence base nursing intervention and integrated care.  The second section discusses a selected paper.

Version A uses a punchline style of writing while version B follows a more academic style of writing.

I would like, in your own generation to combine versions A and B for the first section only. However for the second section, You will have two different version one focused on the paper in version A and the other focused on the paper in version B.  In addition, I would like both generations to use my version B style of writing, that is an academic style with APA7 in-text references and a full reference list at the end.  Note that the reference does not go toward the 1000-word limit count.

Critically assess the papers you have generated according to your professional understanding of the subject in relation to level-7 critical writing.  Explain which is better and why.
