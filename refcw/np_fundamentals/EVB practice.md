Evidence based nursing(EBN) according to the  
International council of Nurses, is defined as ‘a problem  solving approach to clinical decision making that  incorporates a search for the best and latest evidence,  clinical expertise, assessment, and patient preference  
values within the context of caring.

BENEFITS OF EBP IN NURSING  
•It provides nurses with scientific researches and studies to make well-founded decisions to support their day to day clinical practice  
•It helps nurses stay updated about new medical protocols for patient care  
•Provides documented interventions which when applied can aid patient’s outcomes  
•It allows patients to have proactive role in their own healthcare as they can voice their concerns, share their values and preferences
•Equips nurses with more knowledge on risks and benefits of certain diagnostic and therapeutic measures  
•EBP would lead to better patient outcome, reduction in morbidity and mortality and better health indices  
•It would also reduce financial operational cost in healthcare of organizations as expenditure on out-dated supplies/products for certain procedures may no longer be needed  
•Nurses can participate in multidisciplinary investigator initiated research, contribute to various aspects of research or be consumers of research through evidence based nursing.

Challenges of EBP/N
1. Lack of access to research and poor understanding of research process
2. Non harmonised transdisciplinary model of evidence based practice that specifies a common langauge and enriched process for clinical and/or policy decision making.
3. Variables to be considered when selecting an evidence based practices such as age, social class, community resources, and local expertise.
4. Misconceptions surrounding the practice of EBP on the premise of insufficient knowledge and skills for nurses
Conclusion
1.  EBN is an essential component of safe and quality of patient are
2. Research should be integrated into everyday nursing practice both for patients care and nursing education.
3. Take the leap, find your niche and get involved.
4. Research provides the evidence, research is the way.
5. EVB is invaluable to nursing education and practice
