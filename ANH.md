- Cardiac 
- Respiratory 
- Renal 
- Gastrointestinal 
- Neurological 
- Endocrine 
Common, acute, pathophysiological disturbances of these 6 systems will also be explored along with assessment strategies used in managing these disturbances.

### Integrated Nursing Care of the Adult Patient 30 Credits (6HSK1079)
Using a range of flexible and blended approaches this module is designed to aid the student in developing their knowledge and understanding of the continuing care of the adult patient. Using case based scenarios the student will develop care strategies based on the presenting pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms in a variety of care settings underpinned by the sourcing and critical discussion of relevant research and other evidence. Attention will be paid to the assessment of psychological sequelae of both acute and chronic conditions, and the potential intervention strategies available.

### Enhancing Health & Social Care through Inter-professional Education (15) [7HEP1057]
The module is designed to give students further opportunities of working in multi-professional groups in order to improve understanding across professional boundaries and encourage collaborative learning and working that will bring benefit to patient/service-users. The justification for inclusion of inter-professional working within health care is addressed. The module requires students to bring specialist in-depth knowledge of their profession and professional codes of conduct to a group setting so that health and social care pathways are critically reviewed in the context of professional practice

### Nursing Art and Science (30) [7HSK0274]
Using a range of flexible and blended approaches including identification and critical analysis of the evidence base, this module is designed to introduce the student to the societal, economic, and political determinants of health and health behaviours. Attention will be paid to the role of health policy and the research underpinning public health interventions (for instance vaccinations). The module also intends to introduce students to underlying complexity of patient care, including shared decision making, family involvement and the role of the nurse. The module will also introduce the student to the tenets of safe drug administration and the some of the reasons for avoidable drug errors.

### Nursing Art and science (15) [7HSK0274]
This 15-credit level 7 module attempts to link theoretical knowledge into students' professional practice and to encourage increasing independence in clinical decision making. The module aims to explore issues vital for comprehensive effective holistic person-centred care at all stages of adult life. There will be a strong emphasis on the professional challenges nurses face that students will encounter in practice. Methods of delivery include seminars (problem-based/inquiry based learning) and group-work. Sessions will be based on patient scenarios, including actual encounters with service users.

### Leading and Managing Nursing Care for Adult Nursing (30) [7HSK0280]
The aim of this 30-credit, level 7 module, is to facilitate the transformation of a 2nd year student nurse into a registered nurse capable of making significant contributions to the co-ordination and management of complex nursing and integrated care needs of individuals.

### Coordinating care in adult nursing (30) [7HSK0304]
The aim of this 30-credit, level 7 module, is to augment the student's practice learning experience in 2nd year of the MSc programme. The taught content will bolster practice placements and inform their practice assessments. This is an interactive and practical based module that has a strong emphasis on simulation and practical exercises, which aim to explore students' knowledge and understanding of current best, evidence-based practice. This module also provides students with an opportunity to practice, challenge, question, refine and enhance their nursing skills in a safe environment. The module content is divided onto care concepts and takes as its focus the standards of proficiency as stated by the NMC (2018).

### Imagination and innovation in evidence based nursing practice (30)
Students on this module will be supported to create an evidence-based proposal to effect positive change in service delivery. It represents an exciting opportunity for students to engage in a negotiated work-based practice project proposal that will encourage them to focus upon a practice issue of personal and professional interest. Students will be encouraged to explore this in an imaginative and innovative manner which may lead to new ways of improving practice for the benefit of service users from an individual, group or whole service perspective. The project is conceived as having the potential to be taken further by student in a role beyond registration, working within care/service teams. The module will call upon students to further develop and employ both their knowledge of evidence-based practice, their skills of research and inquiry and of project management in adopting a rigorous approach to the project design and organisation.

## Coventry
The Research Process and Evidence-informed Nursing Practice - 20 credits

The development of evidence-informed and evidence-based care from a solid research base is essential to the science of nursing care. The module content is organised to demonstrate the use of evidence within nursing and healthcare practice - for example, in governance policy/guidelines - and how they affect everyday nursing practice. The background understanding of how research is used to develop the evidence base for contemporary nursing practice will be examined by applying research principles to a clinically relevant action research project.

Health Assessment in Nursing - 10 credits

The module aims to enable you to develop skills in identifying and assessing existing conditions, as well as screening for factors predisposing persons to ill health. You will have the opportunity to critically apply healthcare assessment skills used in nursing across the lifespan to formulate a person-centred plan of care.

Clinical Decision-making in Adult Nursing - 10 credits

Clinical decision-making in nursing requires an evaluation of many complex factors. In conjunction with a barrage of health-related information, the nurse needs to have the cognitive skills to appropriate this information to make decisions about the person’s care. This module aims to assist you in developing strategies for clinical decision-making in the context of person-centred care. The module content will be organised around a variety of subjects to include the professional, legal and ethical responsibility and other subject-theory domains that influence clinical decision-making.

Therapeutic Interventions in Adult Nursing - 10 credits

In health and social care environments, nurses meet people living with complex, multiple physical and mental health co-morbidities across the lifespan. Complex care necessitates treatment from multi-professional services and service user involvement in care management and care delivery. The module aim is to facilitate your development of necessary knowledge and proficiency to coordinate and manage patient-centred care in the multidimensional healthcare setting. The module content will include a critical review of the current policy and legislative documents that drive, influence and enhance the coordination of complex care.

Year 1 Practice Placements

You have the opportunity to contribute to the health of the local community throughout the course during practice placements2 where you work approximately 40 hours a week. On placement you will provide a range of nursing care to people across the lifespan, and in a variety of care settings.

**Practice 1: Understanding Nursing Practice - 20 credits**

This module introduces you to the foundations of nursing practice in the workplace. The experience will provide you (under supervision) with learning opportunities which should begin to develop the professional values, attitudes and behaviours required to deliver safe and effective holistic person- and family-centred care.

**Practice 2: Assessment, Delivery and Evaluation - 10 credits**

This module provides a further opportunity for you to review and deliver nursing practice in the workplace critically. This experience will enable you to demonstrate and promote the professional values, attitudes and behaviours required to provide safe and effective holistic person-centred care. The module is underpinned by the NMC Future Nurse Standards of Proficiency for Registered Nurses (2018); and Realising Professionalism: Standards for Professionalism and Education (2018) for nursing and midwifery. The content and assessment will be developed and applied to the different fields of nursing and will provide you with learning opportunities in the workplace to practise nursing.
