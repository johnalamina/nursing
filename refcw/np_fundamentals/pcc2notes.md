## PCC covid
I found a few academic papers that discuss person-centered care during the pandemic. Here are some of them:

1. [**Care during covid-19 must be humane and person centred**](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3483) [1](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3483): This paper argues that person-centered care is essential during the pandemic and that patient and family involvement must be strengthened to achieve this. The authors suggest that a more flexible approach to visiting policies in hospitals and care homes is required to allow family members to be with high-risk patients, especially at the end of life.
    
2. [**Person-Centered Healthcare Practice in a Pandemic Context**](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3483) [2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fresc.2021.726210/full): This study explores people’s experiences of seeking healthcare support during the pandemic and aims to use the person-centered framework to evaluate these experiences. The authors suggest that a re-focus on supporting people with long-term conditions in a person-centered manner is needed.
    
3. [**Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of a person-centered model of care for people with multimorbidity**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265091) [3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265091): This study describes the perception of healthcare teams regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of a person-centered model of care for people with multimorbidity.
    
4. [**The empirical evidence underpinning the concept and practice of person-centredness for serious illness**](https://gh.bmj.com/content/5/12/e003330) [4](https://gh.bmj.com/content/5/12/e003330): This review aimed to identify and appraise the empirical evidence underpinning conceptualizations of ‘person-centeredness’ for serious illness.
    

I hope this helps!

### Glossary
1. **anticipating care**: The preparatory work that a nurse does by reading research, audit, case study and other materials to better understand the possible needs of patients that come into their care.
2. **attribution theory**: The notion that we habitually assign meanings to experiences and endeavours, creating a sense of purpose and sometimes pleasure en route. Attribution theory is important as a means of explaining motivation.
3. **collaborating**: The delivery of person-centred care; the sharing of experiences and activities that are jointly seen as beneficial and which work towards agreed goals.
4. **discourse**: A positional statement or series of arguments that express our values or our understanding of events. So, within nursing, there is a discourse about what person-centred care should look like. In palliative care there is a discourse associated with end-of-life care. Discourses compete and clash within healthcare, making it harder for us to know how best to proceed. To support a discourse, we need to understand the underpinning premises and the values and beliefs that are attached.
5. **empowering/empowerment**: Enabling patients to take increasing control and responsibility regarding their illness and associated needs. It is furthered by sharing information, building confidence and enabling the patient to learn.
6. **evaluating**: The process of summarising what has been learned and achieved through collaborative activity. Evaluation may be interim (judging progress) or summative (judging the care at completion).
7. **medical problem**: The challenge posed by injury or disease and which might create several imperative demands for treatment (see also personal problem).
8. **motivation**: That which sustains individuals in their efforts and that which makes activities meaningful. Understanding motivation is important if patients are to learn well and to maintain self-care in adverse circumstances. There are different ways of describing motivation. It may be driven by a search for rewards, or by an increasing sense of purpose linked to meaningful activities that help confirm a satisfying identity.
9. **narrative**: A story or explanation embedded within a series of words; the dialogues shared with others. The narrative may convey how we see ourselves, how we cope with illness, or (as a nurse or lay carer) how we try to care. Narratives may be hidden. Sometimes the nurse has to check carefully what patients are in fact conveying in their narrative.
10. **negotiating**: The process of jointly deliberating on the possibilities of the care relationship; what needs to be done, who might take responsibility for work and which roles might be adopted.
11. **PERSON**: A mnemonic to help nurses remember what shapes person-centred nursing care. A focus on Perception and a willingness to Explore experiences through narratives; the need to Relate to the patient’s perceptions and to Source the origins of their worries, what might sustain hope; the nurse Outlines a plan with the patient and then will Notify all those asked to assist.
12. **personal problem**: The experience of illness or injury as couched within a person’s individual context. The medical problem is understood and narrated through a personal circumstance and experience (see also medical problem).
13. **person-centred care (pragmatic)**: Care that centres on the person within a healthcare system that sets significant limits on resources, and which serves the many as well as the individual. Pragmatic person-centred care elucidates role responsibilities for the nurse and the patient, acknowledging the expertise that the nurse brings to bear in the service of the patient (see also Chapter 1).
14. **personhood**: That which distinguishes us as whole and different from others. The person is defined by their abilities and aptitudes, by their attitudes and values, and through the relationships they share with others. Illness and treatment may undermine personhood through its impact on the body and on our sense of control over daily living.
15. **rapport**: A mutual state of respect and understanding, where each understands and appreciates the contribution of the other.
16. **relating**:  The second stage of person-centred care where the nurse and the patient meet and explore expectations of one another and the care that might be shared.
17. **role**: In person-centred care, both nurses and patients adopt roles, the better to effect a plan of care. For example, the nurse might play the role of teacher and the patient learner, or, indeed, when the patient is the expert of managing a chronic illness, vice versa.
18. **standard care**: A largely pre-set package of care based upon assessment of the medical problem and commonly arising needs. Standard care packages recognise the challenges of delivering equitable care to all, a transparent commitment to minimum provision.
19. **templates**: Human beings develop working templates (summary explanations) to explain experience and endeavour. Exploring a narrative often reveals such templates so that the nurse and patient can review whether the same are beneficial.
20. **therapeutic relationship**: That which describes how the nurse and patient relate to one another in ways that achieve beneficial ends. To be therapeutic, the nurse musters communication and clinical skills and makes selective use of evidence to guide the patient. The relationship extends to become a culture where a wide range of staff and services are marshalled so as to advance the needs of the individual patient.

## Draft report

Person-centred care is a cornerstone for healthcare, where healthcare professionals work collaboratively with people who use services to develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence they need to more effectively manage and make informed decisions about their own health and healthcare[](https://www.health.org.uk/sites/default/files/PersonCentredCareMadeSimple.pdf)

**[6](https://www.health.org.uk/sites/default/files/PersonCentredCareMadeSimple.pdf)**

. In recent years, the patient care model has changed from the standard care approach, which is identical for all patients, to a patient-centred approach.

"In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the patient care model from a standard care approach to a patient-centred approach. The standard care approach, which was once the norm, involved a one-size-fits-all methodology. This meant that all patients, regardless of their unique needs and circumstances, received identical care.

However, this approach often failed to consider the individual needs, preferences, and values of each patient. It was largely focused on the disease rather than the person suffering from it. As a result, it often led to impersonal care and suboptimal health outcomes.

Recognizing these shortcomings, healthcare providers have increasingly moved towards a patient-centred approach. This approach places the patient at the heart of all decisions and actions. It acknowledges that each patient is unique, and that healthcare should be tailored to meet their specific needs.

In a patient-centred approach, healthcare providers strive to understand the patient’s life context, their health goals, and their values. They involve the patient in decision-making processes, respect their autonomy, and prioritize their comfort and well-being.

This shift towards patient-centred care has been driven by a growing body of research showing its benefits. Studies have shown that patient-centred care can lead to better health outcomes, higher patient satisfaction, and improved healthcare efficiency.

In essence, the change from a standard care approach to a patient-centred approach represents a fundamental shift in how we view and deliver healthcare. It’s about seeing patients as partners in their care rather than passive recipients of care. It’s about delivering care that is not only effective but also respectful and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values."

 Here are some ways in which practice can be effectively related to person-centred care:

[](https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-021-00684-2)

**[3](https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-021-00684-2)**

. Here are some ways in which practice can be effectively related to person-centred care:

Promoting Communication: Communication is a crucial aspect of person-centred care. Healthcare professionals should welcome patients, listen to them, share information with them, seek their consent, and show them respect when providing care.

. Promoting effective communication is a significant factor in providing patient-centred care.

"Effective communication plays a pivotal role in the delivery of patient-centred care. It is not merely about exchanging information, but it’s about understanding the emotions and intentions behind that information. It involves the ability for healthcare professionals to listen attentively, speak clearly, and exhibit empathy, seek their consent, ensuring that patients feel heard, informed, and important.

Effective communication can lead to better patient engagement, improved patient satisfaction, and a higher quality of care. It allows healthcare providers to better understand their patients’ needs and expectations, leading to accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans.

Moreover, it encourages patients to participate actively in decision-making processes, fostering a sense of ownership over their health outcomes. This collaborative approach can lead to improved adherence to treatment plans and ultimately better health outcomes.

In essence, effective communication is a cornerstone of patient-centred care, enhancing the relationship between patients and healthcare providers and promoting a healthcare environment that prioritizes the patient’s needs and preferences."

**[3](https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-021-00684-2)**

.

·       Respectful and Compassionate Care: Healthcare professionals should anticipate the anxiety or fear that patients sometimes experience when receiving care and take responsibility for comforting and reassuring their patients at every step, ensuring patients and their families and caregivers are at the centre of everything they do.

Respectful and Compassionate Care: This principle underscores the importance of empathy and respect in the healthcare profession. Healthcare professionals should be proactive in recognizing and addressing the anxiety or fear that patients often experience when receiving care. This could be due to the unfamiliar environment, the complexity of medical procedures, or the potential implications of a diagnosis.

Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to comfort and reassure their patients at every step of their healthcare journey. This involves clear communication, active listening, and genuine empathy. It’s about more than just providing medical treatment; it’s about providing emotional support and building trust.

Moreover, respectful and compassionate care extends beyond the patient to include their families and caregivers. Recognizing that illness affects more than just the individual patient is crucial. Families and caregivers often share in the patient’s anxiety and fear, and they also need reassurance and support.

In essence, respectful and compassionate care means putting patients and their families at the heart of all decisions and actions. Every procedure, every interaction, every decision should be guided by what is best for the patient and their loved ones. This approach ensures that healthcare is not only effective but also humane."

.

·       Development of Comprehensive Policies: Lack of comprehensive policies is one of the challenges healthcare professionals face in trying to apply person-centred care in daily activities

·         Development of Comprehensive Policies: The absence of comprehensive policies is a significant hurdle that healthcare professionals often encounter when attempting to implement person-centred care in their daily activities. Comprehensive policies are essential for providing a structured framework that guides healthcare professionals in delivering care that is truly centred around the patient.

·         These policies should encompass all aspects of patient care, from the initial consultation and diagnosis, through treatment and follow-up care. They should outline clear guidelines on how to engage with patients, respect their preferences, involve them in decision-making processes, and provide emotional support.

·         However, developing such policies can be challenging due to the complexity of healthcare systems, the diversity of patient needs, and the need to balance individualized care with standard protocols. Furthermore, these policies need to be flexible enough to adapt to new research findings and evolving best practices in healthcare.

·         The lack of such policies can lead to inconsistencies in the delivery of care, confusion among healthcare professionals, and ultimately a less than optimal patient experience. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare institutions to invest in the development and implementation of comprehensive policies that support person-centred care.

·         In essence, comprehensive policies are not just about rules and regulations; they are about creating a culture of person-centred care where every action is guided by the needs and preferences of the patients.

**[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8641711/)**

.

·       Education: Insufficient education in universities and hospitals is another challenge healthcare professionals face in trying to apply person-centred care in daily activities

"Education: A significant challenge that healthcare professionals often face when trying to apply person-centred care in their daily activities is the lack of sufficient education in universities and hospitals. The concept of person-centred care is multifaceted, involving not just medical knowledge, but also skills in communication, empathy, and cultural competence.

However, traditional medical education often focuses heavily on the biomedical aspects of care, with less emphasis on the interpersonal and social aspects. This can leave healthcare professionals ill-prepared to engage with patients in a truly person-centred manner.

Furthermore, ongoing education within hospitals is also crucial for keeping healthcare professionals up to date with the latest best practices in person-centred care. However, such educational opportunities may be lacking due to resource constraints or a focus on more immediate clinical concerns.

This educational gap can lead to a disconnect between the theory of person-centred care and its practical application. It can result in healthcare professionals feeling unsure about how to implement person-centred approaches, leading to inconsistent care experiences for patients.

Therefore, it is essential for educational institutions and healthcare organizations to prioritize the inclusion of person-centred care principles in their curricula and training programs. This could involve interactive workshops, role-play scenarios, and case studies that allow healthcare professionals to practice and reflect on person-centred approaches.

In essence, education is a key enabler of person-centred care. By equipping healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills they need, we can ensure that person-centred care becomes a reality rather than just an ideal."

·       Organizing Nursing Performance: Organizing nursing performance affects the quality of nursing care. Patient-centeredness is one of the best ways to organize nursing care to increase its quality.

·         "Organizing Nursing Performance: The way nursing performance is organized plays a crucial role in determining the quality of nursing care. It involves the structuring of nursing tasks, the coordination of care activities, and the management of resources.

·         However, organizing nursing performance is not just about efficiency; it’s also about ensuring that care is delivered in a way that meets the unique needs and preferences of each patient. This is where the concept of patient-centeredness comes into play.

·         Patient-centeredness is an approach to care that involves seeing the patient as a whole person, not just a set of symptoms or a medical condition. It’s about understanding the patient’s life context, their values, and their goals for health. It’s about involving the patient in decision-making processes and respecting their autonomy.

·         Organizing nursing performance around the principle of patient-centeredness can significantly enhance the quality of care. It ensures that care activities are tailored to the individual patient, leading to more effective and meaningful care. It promotes a holistic approach to care that considers all aspects of the patient’s well-being.

·         Moreover, patient-centeredness can also improve the efficiency of care by reducing unnecessary interventions and focusing resources on what matters most to the patient. It can lead to better health outcomes, higher patient satisfaction, and ultimately a higher quality of care.

·         In essence, organizing nursing performance is not just a logistical task; it’s a strategic decision that can shape the quality of care. By embracing patient-centeredness, we can ensure that our nursing practices are not only efficient but also deeply respectful of our patients’ individuality."
