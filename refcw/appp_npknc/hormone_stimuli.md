Question 2: Giving examples, explore the 3 types of stimulus for the release of hormones.

The three types of stimuli are hormonal, humoral stimulation and a neural stimulation.  

The hormones responsible for hormonal stimulation are known as tropical hormones because their target cells are hormone releasing cells.  That is, they only produce intermediary hormones which stimulate the produce of other hormones.  An example of this is the adreno cortico-tropic hormones.  These hormones stimulate the adrenal glands to release their own adrenal hormones.

The second type of hormonal stimulation method include the humoral stimulation.  These hormones are not stimulated by  hormones but by different substances found in the blood stream.  As these substances flow around the circulatory system, they stimulate receptive glands to secrete their hormones.  An example of humoral stimulation is glucose that can stimulate the pancreas to release either insulin, when there glucose blood sugar level is high or glucagon when the blood sugar level is low.

The third type of hormonal stimulation is the neural stimulation.  These are typically parasympathetic neurons which stimulate glands such as the parasympatheic neurons in lumbar region T5, and T6.  These nerves contain neurons which can release neuro transmitters that bind to receptors on the adrenal gland and stimulate them to produce adrenaline.
