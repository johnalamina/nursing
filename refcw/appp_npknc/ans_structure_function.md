The autonomic nervous system is a division of the Nervous system.  The Nervous system has several sub-divisions.

The central nervous system is positionally located at the anatomical centre of the body and consists of the brain and spinal cord (ref).

The peripheral nervous system is further classified into the somatic and autonomic (automatic) nervous system.  While the somatic nervous system
