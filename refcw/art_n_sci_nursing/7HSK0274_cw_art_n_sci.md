## Health Gap - Mormott Aug 2017

- "My resolution of apparently having it both ways comes from following Amartya Sen.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5837404/#dyx163-B3) Relative inequality with respect to income translates into absolute inequality with respect to capabilities. It is not so much what you have but what you can do with what you have"
- Second, education is correlated with other things in adult life that are related to better health: job, income, place of residence, esteem and relative freedom from stress
- Wilkinson and Pickett in _The Spirit Level_ argue that income inequality damages the health of everyone–the gini coefficient is correlated with average health of a country.
- The first way that massive inequalities of income and wealth can lead to health inequalities is that if the rich have so much, there is less available for everyone else.
- if too much of the money is being sequestered at the top, local and central governments may have too little to spend on pre-school education, schools, improving services and amenities for neighbourhoods–reproducing, two generations later, what in 1958 J. K. Galbraith called ‘private affluence and public squalor’. Taxation is a good source of such money. To show that there is a great deal of money about, one-third of the $24 billion income of the top 25 hedge-fund managers could fund something like 80000 New York schoolteachers.
-  too much inequality of income and wealth damages social cohesion; increasingly the rich are separated from everyone else: separate neighbourhoods, schools, recreation, fitness centres, holidays. Lack of social cohesion is likely to damage health and increase crime.
## Historical view
### Martha's rule
There is recent legislation in the UK known as "Martha's Rule," which allows patients under care to request a second medical opinion if they feel their condition is life-threatening. This rule was named after Martha Mills, a young girl whose death highlighted the need for such a policy. It gives patients and their families the right to seek a rapid review by a separate clinical team, ensuring that concerns about care can be quickly addressed by an independent specialist within the same hospital.

The rule aims to empower patients and improve patient safety by providing a formal mechanism to challenge medical decisions when necessary. Similar systems exist in other parts of the world, like Ryan's Rule in Queensland, Australia, which also allows patients to escalate concerns and request a clinical review if they believe their care is inadequate.

However, the implementation of such a rule does come with challenges, including potential organizational barriers, staffing issues, and ensuring that patients and families feel confident in using the system appropriately.
#### Martha Mills
The Martha Mills case involved a thirteen-year-old girl who died from sepsis in 2021 after sustaining a pancreatic injury from a bike accident. Martha was treated at King’s College Hospital, where despite her deteriorating condition and her mother's concerns, she was not moved to the pediatric intensive care unit in time. The inquest revealed that had she been transferred earlier, she likely would have survived. This led to significant changes in procedures at the hospital and the implementation of "Martha's Rule" across NHS England [The independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/marthas-rule-nhs-sepsis-b2499112.html)[Davies and Partners Solicitors](https://daviesandpartners.com/news-events/davies-and-partners-medical-negligence-team-act-for-family-in-tragic-death-of-martha-mills-13-who-died-from-sepsis/).

Martha's Rule allows patients and their families to request an urgent review by a critical care team if they believe their condition is worsening and not being adequately addressed. This policy aims to empower patients and families and ensure timely responses to critical health concerns, potentially saving lives [Patient safety learning hub](https://www.pslhub.org/learn/patient-engagement/marthas-rule-a-new-policy-to-amplify-patient-voice-and-improve-safety-in-hospitals-september-2023-r10013/).
### NHS Legislation
Throughout its history, the NHS has seen significant legislative changes driven by patient safety cases. One notable example is the aftermath of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust scandal, which revealed appalling standards of care and led to the implementation of stricter patient safety regulations. This resulted in the establishment of the "Duty of Candour," which mandates healthcare providers to be open and honest with patients when things go wrong.

The Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry, another landmark case, focused on the high mortality rates in pediatric heart surgery. This led to major reforms in clinical governance, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and the establishment of new oversight mechanisms to prevent such occurrences.

Another significant development was the creation of the National Patient Safety Agency in 2001. This body was charged with creating a national reporting and learning system for adverse events to help prevent future incidents by learning from past mistakes.

More recently, the response to the Winterbourne View scandal, which exposed the abuse of patients with learning disabilities, led to reforms ensuring better community-based support and stricter regulation of care providers.

These cases highlight a continuous evolution towards improving patient safety through legislation and policy changes in the NHS. [Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-patient-safety/2010-to-2015-government-policy-patient-safety)[PSNet](https://psnet.ahrq.gov/perspective/patient-safety-united-kingdom-evolution-and-progress)

Several broader socioeconomic factors have influenced policy changes in the United Kingdom, particularly in healthcare. Here are a few key examples:

1. **Economic Inequality and Poverty**: High levels of economic inequality and poverty have significant impacts on health outcomes, driving policy changes aimed at reducing disparities. For example, initiatives like the Sure Start program were introduced to provide early childhood support to disadvantaged families, aiming to improve health and social outcomes.

2. **Aging Population**: The increasing proportion of elderly people in the UK has led to policies focusing on elderly care and managing chronic diseases. The establishment of the Care Act 2014 was a response to the growing need for comprehensive and sustainable social care services for the elderly.

3. **Public Health Crises**: Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for robust public health infrastructure and led to significant policy changes, including the implementation of the Health and Care Act 2022. This act focused on improving health service delivery and pandemic preparedness.

4. **Technological Advancements**: Advances in medical technology and digital health have driven policies aimed at integrating these innovations into healthcare delivery. For example, the NHS Long Term Plan includes commitments to digital-first primary care, reflecting the impact of technological advancements on health policy.

5. **Social Movements and Advocacy**: Advocacy by patient groups and social movements often leads to significant policy changes. The creation of "Martha's Rule" is an example where public pressure and advocacy following a tragic event led to new legislation to improve patient rights and safety.

6. **Global Health Trends**: International health policies and global health trends also influence UK health policies. For instance, the adoption of the WHO’s guidelines on antimicrobial resistance has shaped the UK's approach to managing antibiotic use and preventing resistance.

These factors illustrate how a complex interplay of socioeconomic conditions, demographic changes, technological advancements, public health challenges, and advocacy efforts shape health policy in the UK.

### WHO Findings
#### 1. Microbiome
The WHO's key findings on the microbiome highlighted its significant influence on human health, emphasizing its role in disease prevention and management. The report stressed the importance of diet in shaping the microbiome, noting that dietary changes can rapidly alter microbial populations in the gut. It also recognized the potential for microbiome-based therapies, such as probiotics and prebiotics, to improve health outcomes.

Furthermore, the report underscored the need for standardized methods in microbiome research to ensure consistency and reliability in findings. This includes adopting advanced sequencing technologies and integrating machine learning techniques to better analyze complex microbiome data. By understanding the microbiome's interactions with the host and environmental factors, the WHO aims to guide public health strategies and foster innovation in microbiome-related therapies.

Overall, the WHO recommendations call for increased research, better dietary assessment methods, and the development of microbiome-based interventions to enhance global health outcomes[Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00079/full)[Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1257002/full)[Biomed central](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01885-3).
#### Microbial resistance
The World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) highlight several key findings and recommendations that have significantly influenced global and national policies, including those in the United Kingdom.

### Key Findings from WHO Guidelines on AMR:

1. **Rising Resistance Rates**:
   - The WHO reported high resistance rates among common bacterial pathogens, with a 42% resistance rate for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and a 35% rate for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in many countries [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance).

2. **Broad Impact Across Diseases**:
   - AMR affects a range of diseases including bacterial infections, HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Drug-resistant TB, for example, is a significant public health crisis with only two in five affected individuals accessing treatment [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance)[WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/antimicrobial-resistance)

3. **Global Spread and Surveillance Needs**:
   - There is an urgent need for improved surveillance and stewardship programs. The WHO emphasizes the importance of monitoring drug resistance patterns and ensuring the appropriate use of antimicrobials [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance)[WHO](https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB148/B148_11-en.pdf#:~:text=URL%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.who.int%2Fgb%2Febwha%2Fpdf_files%2FEB148%2FB148_11).

4. **One Health Approach**:
   - The WHO advocates for a "One Health" approach, integrating efforts across human health, animal health, and environmental sectors to tackle AMR comprehensively [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance).

### Influence on the UK's Approach:

1. **National Action Plans**:
   - The UK has developed and updated its National Action Plan on AMR, aligning with WHO's recommendations. This plan includes measures to improve antibiotic prescribing practices, enhance infection prevention and control, and promote AMR research and innovation.

2. **Public and Professional Awareness Campaigns**:
   - Following WHO's guidelines, the UK has implemented extensive public awareness campaigns and professional education programs to promote prudent antibiotic use and prevent the spread of resistant infections [BioMed Central](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-17766-w).

3. **Enhanced Surveillance Systems**:
   - The UK has invested in robust AMR surveillance systems to track resistance patterns and the effectiveness of interventions, in line with WHO's emphasis on data-driven strategies.

4. **Global Collaboration**:
   - The UK actively participates in global efforts to combat AMR, supporting WHO initiatives and contributing to international research and policy development.

Overall, WHO's guidelines have provided a framework for the UK to strengthen its policies and actions against AMR, promoting a coordinated and effective response to this global health threat.

### Determinants of Health: Impact of National Health Policy in the United Kingdom and the Role of Family and Social Networks for Sam

#### Abstract
Health outcomes are influenced by a wide range of factors beyond medical care. These factors, known as social determinants of health, play a crucial role in shaping individual well-being and overall population health. This essay explores these determinants, their historical context, and their impact on health policy in the United Kingdom. We examine how Sam's family dynamics and social connections affect his health, particularly considering his recent prostate cancer diagnosis and existing medical conditions. Evidence-based recommendations are provided for addressing these determinants to improve Sam's overall health.

#### Introduction
Health is not solely determined by clinical interventions; it is shaped by various social, economic, and environmental factors. The social determinants of health encompass a wide range of non-medical factors that influence an individual's health trajectory, including socioeconomic status, education, housing, employment, and social networks (Marmot, 2015). For Sam, a 52-year-old African American male residing in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, these factors play a critical role in his health outcomes. This essay delves into the specific determinants affecting Sam's well-being and provides recommendations for improving his overall health.

#### Individual Factors: Sam’s Biopsychosocial Context
##### Biomedical Factors
Sam's medical history includes anxiety, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and clinical obesity. These conditions interact and exacerbate each other, affecting his overall health (NICE, 2020):
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: Poorly managed diabetes can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease and neuropathy (WHO, 2021).
- **Hypertension**: High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease (NHS, 2022).
- **Obesity**: Obesity is associated with various health issues, including cancer (Public Health England, 2019).

##### Psychological Factors
Sam’s recent prostate cancer diagnosis has likely triggered anxiety and depression. Psychological well-being is closely intertwined with physical health, as chronic stress can weaken the immune system and hinder recovery (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010).

##### Social Factors
- **Isolation**: Sam's lack of close family members in the country leaves him socially isolated. Social support is crucial for coping with illness and promoting recovery (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001).
- **Former Social Habits**: Sam used to socialize at the local pub, but his friends have stopped visiting, exacerbating his isolation and potentially leading to unhealthy coping mechanisms.

#### Family Dynamics and Support
##### Family Structure and Function
Sam’s family structure—being a single father raising three children—has significant implications for his health. The absence of extended family members in the country means that Sam lacks additional support. His responsibilities as a caregiver and breadwinner create stress and impact his overall well-being (Marmot, 2015).

##### Emotional Support
Emotional support from family members is crucial during challenging times. However, Sam’s recent cancer diagnosis has strained his emotional well-being. The absence of close family members exacerbates feelings of isolation and depression. Research shows that strong family ties can buffer against mental health issues (Cohen & Wills, 1985).

##### Coping Mechanisms
Sam’s family can serve as a coping mechanism. Unfortunately, the absence of family support may lead him to unhealthy coping strategies, such as increased alcohol consumption. As a former social drinker, Sam’s isolation may exacerbate his reliance on alcohol, affecting both physical and mental health (WHO, 2021).

#### Social Networks and Isolation
##### Social Interaction
Sam’s previous social life—enjoying time with friends at the local pub—provided essential social interaction. However, since his cancer diagnosis, his friends have stopped visiting. Social isolation is associated with adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality risk (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). Sam’s lack of social connections may exacerbate his depression and anxiety.

##### Financial Stress and Social Networks
Sam’s financial struggles, including bailiff visits, contribute to his distress. Social networks can provide financial support, advice, and resources. Unfortunately, Sam’s lack of close friends or family members compounds his financial burden. Research suggests that social networks can mitigate financial stress and improve overall health (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001).

#### Lifestyle Factors
##### Alcohol Consumption
Sam’s previous habit of having a couple of glasses of wine in the evening may have provided some social interaction. However, since his cancer diagnosis, he may be using alcohol as a coping mechanism. Excessive alcohol consumption can worsen health outcomes (NHS, 2022).

##### Financial Stress
Sam’s financial struggles—bailiff visits due to unpaid bills—add to his stress. Financial instability affects health by limiting access to nutritious food, healthcare, and housing (Marmot, 2015).

#### Broader Community Provision and National Health Policy
##### UK Healthcare System
The National Health Service (NHS) provides universal healthcare, but Sam’s experiences may vary based on local resources and funding (The King’s Fund, 2019). Key aspects include:
- **Primary Care**: Access to general practitioners (GPs) and community services is essential for managing chronic conditions.
- **Cancer Services**: Timely diagnosis, treatment, and emotional support are critical for cancer patients (NICE, 2020).

##### Critique of Evidence
We evaluate evidence from various sources:
- **NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence)**: Clinical guidelines and cost-effectiveness assessments.
- **Department of Health**: Policy documents shaping healthcare provision.
- **Public Health England**: Epidemiological data on health disparities.
- **The King’s Fund**: Research on health system performance.
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Global health perspectives.

#### Recommendations
##### Strengthening Family and Social Networks
- **Support Groups**: Encourage Sam to join cancer-specific support groups for emotional support and information sharing (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001).
- **Virtual Connections**: Facilitate online interactions with distant family members to alleviate isolation.
- **Community Activities**: Sam should engage in local community events to combat isolation (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010).

##### Addressing Lifestyle and Financial Stress
- **Counseling Services**: Sam could benefit from counseling to cope with anxiety and depression (WHO, 2021).
- **Financial Advice**: Connect Sam with financial advisors to manage debts and reduce stress (The King’s Fund, 2019).
- **Social Prescribing**: Explore non-medical interventions (e.g., exercise classes, art groups) to improve well-being (NICE, 2020).

#### Conclusion
Sam’s health journey is influenced by a web of interconnected factors. By addressing family dynamics, social networks, lifestyle, and community provision, we can enhance his quality of life. Policymakers must recognize the importance of holistic care and invest in evidence-based interventions to promote health equity.
