**Introduction**

**Person-centred care** is a nursing approach that focuses on the individual needs, preferences, and values of the patient. It is a holistic approach that considers the patient's physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. Person-centred care is essential for providing high-quality nursing care, as it ensures that patients are treated with respect and dignity.

**Critical reflection** is a process of examining one's own experiences and actions to identify areas for learning and improvement. It is an essential skill for nurses, as it allows them to reflect on their practice and identify ways to improve the quality of care they provide.

Critical reflection can help nurses to:

- Better understand their own thoughts, feelings, and biases
- Identify areas where their practice can be improved
- Develop new skills and knowledge
- Make more informed decisions in practice
- Provide more person-centred care

**The Nurse's Role in Person-Centred Care**

Nurses play a vital role in person-centred care. They are responsible for assessing the patient's needs, developing a care plan, and implementing and evaluating care. Nurses must also be able to communicate effectively with patients, their families, and other healthcare professionals.

**Responsibilities and competencies of nurses in assessing and planning care:**

- Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's physical, mental, emotional, and social needs
- Identify the patient's goals and priorities
- Develop a care plan that is tailored to the patient's individual needs and preferences
- Collaborate with the patient, their family, and other healthcare professionals to develop and implement the care plan

**Evidence-based, compassionate, and safe nursing practices:**

- Provide care that is based on the best available scientific evidence
- Treat patients with compassion and respect
- Create a safe environment for patients

**Coordinating care and ensuring its effective delivery:**

- Coordinate care with other healthcare professionals to ensure that the patient receives the best possible care
- Monitor the patient's progress and make adjustments to the care plan as needed
- Evaluate the quality of care provided

**Monitoring patients' needs and evaluating the quality of care provided:**

- Monitor the patient's physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being
- Identify any changes in the patient's condition
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the care plan and make adjustments as needed
- Solicit feedback from the patient and their family to evaluate the quality of care provided

**Critical Reflection on the Nurse's Role**

**Personal experiences and observations related to person-centred care:**

Reflect on your own experiences and observations related to person-centred care. Think about a time when you were able to provide person-centred care to a patient. What did you do? How did the patient respond? What was the outcome?

**Impact of your actions on patients, their families, and other healthcare professionals:**

Analyze the impact of your actions on patients, their families, and other healthcare professionals. Think about a time when your actions had a positive impact. Think about a time when your actions had a negative impact. What could you have done differently?

**Areas where your practice can be improved and strategies for further development:**

Identify areas where your practice can be improved. What new skills or knowledge do you need to develop? What resources can you use to help you improve your practice?

**Scholarly articles on the importance of critical reflection and person-centred care in nursing practice:**

- **Person-Centred Care: A Definition and Review** (2015) by Jane Kitson, Marie-Therese Harvey, and Claire McCormack
- **Critical Reflection in Nursing Practice: A Model for Professional Development** (2008) by Graham Gibbs
- **The Importance of Critical Reflection in Person-Centred Care** (2017) by Annmarie Kinsella and Patricia O'Brien

- **The Role of Critical Reflection in Person-Centred Care: A Review of the Literature** (2019) by Elaine Watson and Karen O'Brien

**Conclusion**

Critical reflection is an essential skill for nurses who want to provide person-centred care. By reflecting on their experiences and actions, nurses can identify areas for improvement and develop new skills and knowledge. This can help nurses to provide better quality care to their patients.

### PCC checklist
1. Have I checked my work against the learning outcomes - are they achieved in my essay. To meet the learning outcomes, the essay needs to include a critical reflection on the following:
	1. What it means to practice effectively - look at the NMC (2018) code.
	2. Define person centred care. 
	3. Select a specific example from practice to demonstrate how you provided person centred care and link it with 
	4. how you practice effectively.
	5. As part of the critical reflection consider what went well.

	7. your knowledge and practice
	8. All discussion points must be supported with relevant literature.
	9. Summarise your findings – do not introduce anything new in the conclusion.
