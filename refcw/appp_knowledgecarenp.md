## Fundaments of anatomy notes
### Endocrine system
#### Hormones
- Upregulation is the creation of more receptors in response to low circulating levels of a hormone; the cell becomes more responsive to the presence of hormones in the blood.
- Down regulation is the reduction of the number of receptors and is often the response of a cell to prolonged periods of high circulating levels of horomone; the cell becomes less responsive (desensitised) to a hormone
#### Types of glands
1. Exocrine glands - have ducts
2. Endocrine glands - no ducts
