### Endocrine system
The endocrine system is a system of messaging within the human body.  There are several organs responsible for the secretion of different types of chemicals.  These chemicals are typically known as hormones.  However, for the hormones to reach their target destinations successfully, the body needed to develop effective mechanism to filter the correct chemicals for the appropriate target cells within the endocrine system.  This is achieved through what are known as hormone hormone receptors.

The hormone receptors act as an antennae to which can be tuned to different frequencies.  The chemicals which match the frequencies will be received into the cell and those that do not match will be rejected.

The mechanism is quite effective such that these chemical substances carried by the blood can travel distances that could be short, within an organ or far across the body. This is exemplified in the x hormone that travels y distance to z organ.

Another challenge faced by the body is regulating how much of the chemical is taken in by the target organ of the target hormone.  This is dominated by several factors such as the pressure or flow of blood to the target organ.  Since this is a variable that is out of control for the target organ.  Another mechanism to manage intake of the hormones by the target organs is that of up regulation and down regulation.

Up regulation controls the amount of hormones being taken into the cells by increasing the number of receptors being produced by the target tissues or increasing the sensitivity of those receptors.  Down regulation in contrast performs the exact opposite of up-regulation.  That is, they decrease the number of receptors or the sensitivity of those receptors to the hormone being targeted by the end-receptor cells.
